BOOTCAMP -DAY 9
Task 1: Life Expectancy Chart
What I Learned:
Created a line chart in Excel with Year (X-axis) vs. Average Life Expectancy (Y-axis).
Used trendlines to analyze life expectancy growth over time.
Challenges Faced:
Finding a reliable dataset with consistent country-wise life expectancy data.
Handling missing values in certain years.
Output:
âœ” A line chart showing the trend of life expectancy over time.

ðŸ“Š Task 2: Income Chart
What I Learned:
Created a multi-line chart in Excel with:
Year (X-axis)
Average, Min, and Max Income (Y-axis).
Used different colored lines to represent each income type.
Challenges Faced:
Differentiating between min, max, and average income visually.
Handling data inconsistencies from different sources.
Output:
âœ” An income trend chart showing economic growth patterns.

Task 3: Rise of Cell Phones
What I Learned:
Merged two datasets (Cell Phones & Population) using Country + Year as keys.
Created a new column to calculate the number of cell phones per person.
Plotted a line chart in Excel with:
X-axis: Year
Y-axis: Number of Cell Phones Per Person
Challenges Faced:
Data Cleaning: Standardized country names to ensure consistency.
Handling Missing Data: Some countries had incomplete population records, requiring adjustments.
Visualization Issues: Ensured proper scaling to make trends visible for both high and low population countries.
Output:
âœ” A line chart showing the increase in mobile phone penetration over time.
âœ” Clear insights into the global adoption of mobile phones.

Task 4: World Map (Population by Country with Year Slider)
What I Learned:
Created an interactive map in Power BI with:
Country as the location.
Population as the color scale (darker colors for higher populations).
Year slider for dynamic filtering.
Challenges Faced:
Ensuring correct country names for mapping in Power BI.
Adjusting color gradients for better readability.
Output:
âœ” A dynamic world map showing population trends over time.
