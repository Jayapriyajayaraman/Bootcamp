# Data Analysis Bootcamp - Day 7

## ðŸ“š Task 1: Understanding SQL and Database Concepts

### What I Learned:
- Explored the fundamentals of SQL and its importance in data analysis.
- Understood the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Learned about database normalization, ACID properties, and different SQL databases.

### Challenges Faced:
- Understanding normalization concepts and their real-world applications.
- Differentiating between DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL commands.

### Output:
âœ” A summarized document covering SQL concepts, database models, and normalization techniques.

## ðŸ“š Task 2: Loading Data into MySQL Using Python

### What I Learned:
- Extracted data from an Excel file and converted it into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Established a connection between Python and MySQL using mysql-connector.
- Loaded datasets into MySQL and verified data integrity.

### Challenges Faced:
- Handling data type mismatches between Pandas and MySQL.
- Debugging connection errors while linking Python to MySQL.

### Output:
âœ” Successfully loaded "Cell Phones (Total)" and "Population" datasets into MySQL tables.

---

## ðŸ“š Task 3: SQL Aggregations and Data Analysis

### What I Learned:
- Applied SQL aggregation functions (MAX, AVG, SUM) to analyze dataset trends.
- Used GROUP BY to summarize data across different years.

### Challenges Faced:
- Ensuring correct usage of aggregate functions for meaningful insights.
- Handling NULL values and incorrect data entries.

### Output:
âœ” A report showcasing the total, average, and maximum number of cell phones per year.

---

## ðŸ“š Task 4: SQL Joins and Data Relationships

### What I Learned:
- Merged multiple tables using SQL JOIN operations.
- Computed the number of cell phones per person by combining datasets.

### Challenges Faced:
- Selecting the right type of JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) for analysis.
- Handling missing data when joining tables.

### Output:
âœ” SQL query output displaying the number of cell phones per person for each country and year.

---

## ðŸ“š Task 5: Advanced SQL - Window Functions

### What I Learned:
- Used window functions to retrieve the country with the maximum cell phones for each year.
- Explored the difference between RANK() and DENSE_RANK().

### Challenges Faced:
- Ensuring correct partitioning in window functions for accurate results.
- Filtering out NULL or zero values from the analysis.

### Output:
âœ” A table displaying the country with the maximum cell phones for each year.

---

## ðŸ“š Bonus Task: Finding Nearby Restaurants

### What I Learned:
- Implemented ranking functions (RANK and DENSE_RANK) to order restaurants based on distance.
- Rounded off distances to the nearest integer for better readability.

### Challenges Faced:
- Managing large datasets efficiently in SQL queries.
- Optimizing query performance for ranking-based calculations.

### Output:
âœ” A ranked list of restaurants based on proximity to a chosen location.
