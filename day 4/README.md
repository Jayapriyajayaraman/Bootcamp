Bootcamp - Day 4
ðŸ“– Task 1: Understanding & Exploring Data Bias
What I Learned:
Explored the concept of bias in AI and data analysis.
Identified different types of biases in datasets and AI-generated responses.
Challenges Faced:
Finding real-world examples of biased AI outputs.
Differentiating between various types of biases in data.
Output:
âœ” A documented list of biases found in AI-generated responses and datasets.

ðŸ“– Task 2: Data Cleaning & Bias Detection
What I Learned:
Applied data cleaning techniques to remove inconsistencies and biases.
Identified bias-prone attributes in the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
Challenges Faced:
Understanding how biases influence data-driven decisions.
Deciding which attributes should be modified or removed.
Output:
âœ” A report highlighting biased attributes in the dataset and their potential impact.
ðŸ“– Task 3: Customer Segmentation
What I Learned:
Grouped customers based on demographics and behavior.
Used clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to identify customer segments.
Challenges Faced:
Choosing the right number of clusters for meaningful segmentation.
Handling categorical data effectively in clustering models.
Output:
âœ” Visualized customer segments using charts and clustering techniques.

ðŸ“– Task 4: Identifying Customer Churn Indicators
What I Learned:
Analyzed features that contribute to customer churn.
Used correlation matrices and feature importance rankings.
Challenges Faced:
Interpreting correlation values and their significance.
Handling imbalanced data in churn prediction.
Output:
âœ” A list of top predictors for customer churn, visualized in a report.

ðŸ“– Task 5: Suggesting Customer Retention Strategies
What I Learned:
Developed data-driven strategies to reduce churn rates.
Proposed business insights based on customer behavior and churn indicators.
Challenges Faced:
Balancing business needs with data-driven recommendations.
Identifying actionable insights that can be implemented in real-world scenarios.
Output:
âœ” A structured report outlining actionable customer retention strategies.
ðŸ“– Bonus Task: Interactive Churn Dashboard
What I Learned:
Built an interactive dashboard to visualize customer churn insights.
Used Streamlit/Plotly Dash for real-time data exploration.
Challenges Faced:
Ensuring smooth performance with large datasets.
Designing an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard layout.
Output:
âœ” A fully functional interactive dashboard for customer churn analysis.

ðŸ”” Summary
Day 4 focused on Big Data, bias detection, customer segmentation, and churn analysis. The hands-on tasks provided deep insights into data fairness, customer behavior, and business strategy development. Looking forward to diving into more advanced machine learning conceptsÂ next!Â ðŸš€
