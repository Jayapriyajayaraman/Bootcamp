Bootcamp - Day 2
ðŸ“– Task 1: Life Expectancy Chart
What I Learned:
Created a line chart to analyze life expectancy trends over the years.
Used Excel and Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
Challenges Faced:
Handling missing values in the dataset.
Formatting the chart to enhance clarity.
Output:
âœ” A well-structured line chart showcasing life expectancy trends across different years.

ðŸ“– Task 2: Income Chart
What I Learned:
Visualized income distribution over time using line charts.
Compared data trends between different years.
Challenges Faced:
Adjusting scale differences to avoid misleading representations.
Choosing appropriate axis labels to improve readability.
Output:
âœ” A detailed income trend line chart illustrating global income shifts.

ðŸ“– Task 3: Rise of Cell Phones
What I Learned:
Analyzed the increasing adoption of mobile phones globally.
Created a multi-line chart to compare data across various countries.
Challenges Faced:
Filtering relevant data for multiple countries.
Ensuring clear color differentiation for each country.
Output:
âœ” A comparative multi-line chart depicting mobile phone adoption trends.

ðŸ“– Task 4: Happiness Score
What I Learned:
Studied happiness score variations across multiple nations.
Used multi-line plots for effective data representation.
Challenges Faced:
Choosing appropriate colors for clear country distinctions.
