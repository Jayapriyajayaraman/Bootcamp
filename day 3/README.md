 Bootcamp - Day 3
ðŸ“– Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation
What I Learned:
Explored techniques to clean and preprocess raw data.
Used Pandas to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
Challenges Faced:
Dealing with large datasets without slowing down processing.
Identifying and correcting outliers that affected data accuracy.
Output:
âœ” A cleaned dataset ready for analysis, free of inconsistencies and missing values.

ðŸ“– Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
What I Learned:
Used statistical summaries to understand dataset distributions.
Visualized data trends with histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
Challenges Faced:
Choosing the right type of visualization for different datasets.
Handling skewed distributions and understanding their impact on analysis.
Output:
âœ” A set of insightful visualizations highlighting key patterns in the data.
ðŸ“– Task 3: Correlation Analysis
What I Learned:
Calculated correlation coefficients to identify relationships between variables.
Used Seaborn heatmaps to visualize correlations.
Challenges Faced:
Interpreting correlation values correctly (correlation â‰  causation).
Managing datasets with mixed data types (numerical vs categorical).
Output:
âœ” A correlation heatmap showing the strength of relationships between key variables.

ðŸ“– Task 4: Feature Engineering
What I Learned:
Created new variables to enhance model performance.
Applied techniques like binning, scaling, and one-hot encoding.
Challenges Faced:
Selecting relevant features without introducing noise.
Balancing feature complexity to avoid overfitting.
Output:
âœ” A refined dataset with meaningful features for further analysis.
ðŸ“– Task 5: Trend Analysis
What I Learned:
Analyzed historical data to identify patterns and trends.
Used rolling averages and time series decomposition for insights.
Challenges Faced:
Handling missing timestamps in time series data.
Differentiating between short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
Output:
âœ” A trend analysis report highlighting key changes over time.

ðŸ“– Bonus Task: Interactive Data Dashboard
What I Learned:
Built an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash/Streamlit.
Integrated filters to allow users to explore data dynamically.
Challenges Faced:
Ensuring smooth performance with large datasets.
Designing an intuitive layout for a better user experience.
Output:
âœ” A fully interactive dashboard for real-time data exploration.

ðŸ”” Summary
Day 3 was all about preparing, exploring, and analyzing data. It reinforced the importance of data cleaning, feature selection, and visualization before diving into deeper analysis. Excited for the next stageâ€”predictiveÂ modeling
