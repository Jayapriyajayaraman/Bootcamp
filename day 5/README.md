 Bootcamp - Day 5

Overview

Day 5 of the Data Analysis Bootcamp focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text analytics using real-world commentary data. The tasks include extracting insights from textual data, transforming text into numerical representations, and building visualization models.

Task List

ðŸ“– Task 1: Commentary Word Cloud

What I Learned:

Explored text preprocessing techniques for cleaning and filtering stopwords.

Developed a word cloud to visualize frequent terms in cricket commentary.

Challenges Faced:

Removing all irrelevant words while preserving key terms.

Ensuring accurate frequency representation in the word cloud.

Output:
âœ” A Word Cloud Figure displaying the most frequent words with the largest size, excluding stopwords.

ðŸ“– Task 2: Commentary to Table

What I Learned:

Applied regular expressions to extract structured data from unstructured commentary.

Identified key attributes like bowler, batter, shot type, and ball type.

Challenges Faced:

Handling inconsistencies in commentary text formats.

Ensuring accurate extraction of attributes.

Output:
âœ” A structured table and a Line Chart representing extracted insights.

ðŸ“– Task 3: Text Pre-processing Methods using Scikit-learn

What I Learned:

Implemented CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer for text feature extraction.

Understood how word frequency impacts model interpretation in NLP.

Challenges Faced:

Understanding how vectorization impacts model performance.

Choosing the best method for different NLP tasks.

Output:
âœ” Representation of text data transformed into numerical vectors.

ðŸ“– Task 4: Implementing TF-IDF from Scratch on the Commentary Dataset

What I Learned:

Built a TF-IDF model from scratch using mathematical formulas.

Verified accuracy by comparing results with scikit-learnâ€™s implementation.

Challenges Faced:

Implementing mathematical formulas efficiently.

Ensuring accuracy when comparing manual implementation with scikit-learnâ€™s version.

Output:
âœ” A comparison between manual implementation and Scikit-learnâ€™s built-in TF-IDF.

ðŸ”” Summary
Day 5 focused on text analytics, natural language processing, and data visualization. The hands-on tasks provided deep insights into:

Extracting meaningful insights from raw text data.

Implementing feature extraction techniques.

Understanding text vectorization, a key concept in NLP.

By completing these exercises, I gained essential skills in text mining, machine learning, and data visualization, which are crucial for advanced AI and NLP applications.
